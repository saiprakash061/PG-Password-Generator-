### Password Generator  
**Developed by Saiprakash**  

---

## Overview  
The **Password Generator** is a Java-based console application designed to generate strong, random passwords and evaluate password strength. It was developed during my Winter Break in the second year of my BTech program as part of my learning journey in Object-Oriented Programming with Java. Inspired by a conversation about password security, this project served as a hands-on application of Java programming concepts and showcases a practical solution for enhancing password security.

## Features  

### 1. **Password Generation**  
The application creates completely random passwords based on user preferences.  
**Process**:  
- Users can specify whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols in their password.  
- Users specify the desired password length.  
- A password is generated by combining random characters from the specified criteria and displayed on the console.  

### 2. **Password Strength Checker**  
The application evaluates the strength of any user-provided password based on the following criteria:  
- Includes uppercase letters.  
- Includes lowercase letters.  
- Contains numbers.  
- Contains symbols.  
- Length of 8 or more characters (decent strength).  
- Length of 16 or more characters (good strength).  

The evaluation provides feedback to the user as one of the following:  
- **Weak**  
- **Medium**  
- **Good**  
- **Great**  

### 3. **Password Security Guidelines**  
To help users understand password best practices, the application displays helpful information, such as:  
- Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts.  
- Avoid sequential characters, keyboard patterns, or dictionary words.  
- Create passwords with a mix of character types to maximize strength.

## Motivation  
This project was inspired by a need to practice Java programming and to solve a real-world problem: improving password security. It started as a console-based application but has plans for future enhancements, such as a user-friendly graphical interface (available in the **Password-Services** repository).

## How to Use  

1. **Run the Application**:  
   Compile and execute the program in a Java-supported IDE or terminal.  

2. **Generate a Password**:  
   - Answer "Yes" or "No" to questions about including specific character types.  
   - Enter the desired password length.  
   - The randomly generated password is displayed.  

3. **Check Password Strength**:  
   - Input a password to be evaluated.  
   - Receive feedback on the strength of the password.  

4. **Review Password Security Tips**:  
   - Access helpful tips for creating and managing secure passwords.

## Future Enhancements  
- Develop a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for improved usability.  
- Extend the password strength checker to include advanced criteria, such as entropy calculation.  
- Add integration with password management tools.
